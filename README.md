# Authentication

In this app I tried to make it with few constrations in it.
This will be an offline app, so everything should be saved locally.
The app should be compatible with any screen resolution.
All validations will be expected like â€“ Mobile validation: validate Indian mobile numbers only;
Email validation: regex-based email validation; name/domain min 4 character and max 25 characters
Password validation: min 8 and max 15 characters, should not contain your name, the first character
should be lowercase, must contain at least 2 uppercase characters, 2 digits and 1 special character.
